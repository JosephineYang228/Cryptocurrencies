# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview of the Project
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. So, they’ve asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.  
The data I will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what I am looking for, I have decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, I decided on a clustering algorithm. I’ll use data visualizations to share her findings with the board.
